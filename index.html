            <p class="font-bold">Hello! I am Madhu,a prospective SUTD student.</p>
            <p>I just finished my A level and I am currenlty applying for universities. I was from Anderson Serangoon Junior College and was part of the Interact Club.<br><br> My interest for technology evolved after working at a hospital where I gained knowledge and expertise into the interaction of healthcare and technology. Continuing from this spark of interest, I learned html from W3Schools and YouTube and decided to create this simple website portfolio for myself as an implementation of what I have learned thus far! I also made use of Tailwindcss to aid me in designing this portfolio ;) </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">As someone who always looks for ways to serve the community and enjoys starting up projects to champion for a particular cause, I joined the Interact Club in JC and embarked on a casual racism project. It was aimed to raise awareness about casual racism since it mirrored my principles of social justice and equal treatment for all. Besides, we also provide for weekly outreach sessions to 4 different organisations namely the Cheshire Home,Institute of Mental Health, Marsiling Primary and TOUCH centre for independent living. Since my batch was affected by COVID and were unable to go down in person to volunteer, we held the outreach sessions via zoom and organised activities for them.  </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">As a member of the drama club since primary 3, I was able to improve my confidence and public speaking abilities. Drama club gave me the opportunity to venture into the world of Shakespeare, Matilda the musical, Mulan the musical and shadow plays. I was the stage manager for our SYF performance, which required me to design props and oversee the set, lights, and sound. Like a diamond forged under pressure, I emerged more disciplined and learnt how to react swiftly to situations, and to handle pressure and deadlines.</p>
